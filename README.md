# PDF Assembler GUI

This project provides a self-contained PDF editing toolkit consisting of:

- A lightweight `pdfassembler` library that exposes an editable object model for PDF pages, text, and images.
- A Tkinter-based desktop GUI that uses the library to load, edit, move, and save page items.

The solution focuses on usability while keeping dependencies minimal so it can run in environments without network access.

## Features

- Load and save PDFs that were created or previously edited with this tool.
- Drag text and image items around a page canvas.
- Double-click text to edit its content and font size.
- Insert new text or PNG images with simple dialogs.
- Object model exposed through the `pdfassembler` package for scripting and automated transformations.

> **Note**: Because the repository is self-contained, the reader application can only open PDFs generated by this tool (they contain embedded metadata that keeps the editable object model). Editing arbitrary third-party PDFs would require the original `pdfassembler` project or a full PDF parser, which is outside the scope of this offline environment.

## Running the GUI

1. Ensure you have Python 3.11+ with Tkinter available.
2. Install the project in editable mode (optional, but keeps the CLI available):
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
3. Launch the GUI:
   ```bash
   python -m pdfassembler_gui
   ```
   or, if installed, simply run:
   ```bash
   pdfassembler-gui
   ```

## Running the Test Suite

Execute the automated tests with pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

The tests exercise the pdfassembler object model and serialization pipeline, ensuring that round-tripping through the PDF writer preserves objects as expected.

## Project Layout

- `src/pdfassembler/`: Standalone PDF editing library with load/save support and an in-memory object model.
- `src/pdfassembler_gui/`: Tkinter GUI that consumes the library.
- `tests/`: Automated regression tests.
